A long time ago, ajax wasn't even known as ajax, but firefox introduced a toSource() method in JavaScript that created the interesting possibility of improving data exchange between client and server.

This repository contains some of the code I wrote at the time. It mostly implements Ajax, but also has an interesting(?) feature of allowing streaming of data through JavaScript.

This is old and badly coded, but it worked at the time.
